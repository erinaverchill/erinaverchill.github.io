      <p>This is always the part where I get stuck. The personal bio. What do you want to know about me? What do I want you to know about me? Who am I? What am I doing here? What are any of us even doing here? What is the meaning of life? Are you still reading this?<br>Take a deep breath. Inhale. Exhale. Everything's going to be okay. Since you're already here, why don't you stay awhile? Take a look at what I've been working on. If you feel so inclined, judge my work. Send me your harshest critique. I'm always striving for better.<br>Or perhaps you stumble upon something of intrigue. Curious to learn more? Want to work with me? I'm honored. Let's link. Maybe even build something together. My inbox is open.</p>
