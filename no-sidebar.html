					<p style="font-size:12px"><i>unemployment humor. I swear I've been busy. hire me pls</p></i>
					</center>

					<br>
					<p>Writing about myself, to this extent, feels so indulgent. But if you're looking to get to know me a little better, here's a place to start.</p>

					<p>My professional experience, coupled with a sincere passion for learning, would undoubtedly be an asset to any organization. After several years working a variety of roles in the private sector, I am eager to do technical work I love for a mission-driven organization I believe in. I yearn to leverage my experience in nuanced analysis and multidisciplinary collaboration to facilitate the accessible distribution of critical information and services in my own communities and around the world.

					<p> My penchant for research and analysis revealed itself in my undergraduate education. With four other seniors from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, I was chosen by the Finance Department Chair to represent our school in the annual CFA Institute Equity Research Challenge. We won the Los Angeles Regional competition, advancing to the international semifinals in Atlanta, GA. For each round of competition, we presented and defended our findings to a panel of industry professionals. We invested hundreds of hours researching the Walt Disney Company (DIS) and selecting models to calculate the stock’s projected return. Our conclusions were articulated in a 10 page summary report supported by 100+ pages of appendices, including a market profile/business description, a multi-sector industry analysis, an investment summary & valuation (models: discount cash flow, comparables, discount dividend, linear and multivariate regression, statistical equity), financial statement analysis, and comprehensive risk analyses.</p>

					<p>I began my career as a Consultant at Ernst & Young, where I created business development proposals and management action plans for major banking, asset management, and fintech organizations. While performing policy research, regulatory analysis, and compliance audit tasks, I developed technical skills in SQL and Tableau, writing queries, creating dashboards, and compiling analysis reports for our clients.</p>

					<p>Then, I was recruited to Uber, where I carved a unique role for myself as an independent compliance consultant within the company and subject matter expert in the Airports market. It was here where I grew especially interested in data science when collaborating with the Fraud team to incorporate analytics into our audit function. I used SQL, Jupyter Notebook, and Excel/Google Sheets, and reviewed and validated SQL queries and Python-based quantitative models developed by Operations and Data Science teams. I led cross-functional teams across Legal, Operations, Engineering, and Finance to streamline 100+ airport reporting processes into a set of “gold standard” frameworks. </p>

					<p> My departure from Uber was bittersweet, as I was excited to travel and move home to reconnect with my family, but I cared deeply about the people I worked with and loved the challenge each new day brought us. Sometimes, I wondered why I left when I did. Right before the IPO? After we had already endured the lowest points of its past regulatory and leadership blunders? I reported to a brilliant, compassionate Senior Manager who I deeply admire, and worked with a rock-solid team of professional skeptics within Internal Audit. Our department built a reputation as an ethical beacon when the future of the company looked grim. We built meaningful bonds with Operations, Product/Engineering, Legal, and Fintech teams across the company based on trust, respect, and committed, hard work, even when challenges felt insurmountable.</p>

					<p>The truth is, I learned more at Uber in my 2+ years there than I have anywhere else for that same duration. I still miss it, but I also knew I was ready for something different. At the time, I volunteered my free time writing content & producing events for a local nonprofit and arts/creative agency. Quite honestly, it was one of the most fulfilling and enriching times of my life, and at the dawn of my mid-twenties, it felt like the right time to change course and pursue a more personal, mission-driven career path. It felt like now or never.</p>

					<p>Tangentially, I am deeply fortunate to have had access to quality mental health care as a young adult. Unrelated to my career change decision, 25 years old was also when I decided to quit drinking, after ten years of putting my mind, body, and spirit through the ringer. Without the support network afforded to me by a lucrative professional job and an infinitely patient, loving family, I may not have had the resources to improve myself on such a fundamental level before it took a toll on my life. Though this level of candor about my past struggle with substance abuse feels risky, I find it hard to be anything but genuine about this journey. The experience helped shape the core tenants of my ambition today. Everyone should have access to the healthcare they need, and I often think of how many people could be saved if we could get treatments to people more efficiently and affordably. </p>

					<p>The mental clarity sobriety provided reminded me why I left my beloved team Uber -- to deepen my level of civic engagement and pursue further education in data analytics. After a few months of traveling, nonstop reading, and volunteering as a community organizer for a Democratic Presidential campaign, I began UC Irvine's Data Analytics & Visualization program, developing and collaborating on a variety of projects which incorporated advanced computer programming and analysis tools. Using statistical Python packages (pandas, scipy, numpy, matplotlib), we investigated cyclical relationships between educational attainment and economic outcomes. I constructed a database from scratch in PostgreSQL to store public datasets representing city budget expenditures and possible markers of state violence (officer complaints, deaths in custody) after extracting the data from open government data portals and cleansing it in Jupyter Notebook. On another project, we crafted a Python machine learning model (scikit-learn) to predict love & relationship success via an HTML/CSS interface, deployed to AWS with Flask API endpoints. </p>

					<p>Immersing myself in my recent studies at UCI alloted me some time to gain civic work experience. I was employed to operate multi-day polls in the 2020 Primary Election to enable the implementation of new voting processes, and later, federally contracted as an Enumerator for the U.S. Census Bureau. There, I collected resident data for the decennial Census by going door-to-door surveying my neighbors and community.</p>

					<p>After completing the Data Analytics course, I got a taste of the startup life working at an Artificial Intelligence (AI) startup, VITRU AI. As an intern, I designed the brand identity and website using Wix, Canva, and Photoshop. As a Research & Business Development Manager, I perform in-depth prospecting and industry research, source new leads, coordinate networking and sales meetings, draft impactful project proposals, and compose marketing copy for the organization. What drew me to VITRU was its clear potential to generate meaningful, technological impact through the architecture of custom AI systems for organizations in environmental, healthcare, and civic/governance spaces. Seriously, that company is going places. I’m so, so proud of the work our small, but mighty, team has accomplished in the past few months. At this time I’m simply seeking a full-time position with a bit more structure than an early-stage startup, at least while I continue to deepen my technical skills. Nevertheless, it’s been an adventure poring over research papers while navigating how to initiate meaningful conversations with potential clients. </p>

					<p>Truthfully, AI used to really, really scare me. In many cases, it still does, but the process of slowly learning more of the rudimentary math, code, and theory behind popular algorithms and models made the inevitable feel more digestible. I think we are all reaching a collective, sobering realization that intelligent systems are already everywhere around us, dictating much of what we do each day. That’s why, given my interest in human rights and professional experience as a data analyst/compliance consultant, I feel driven to deepen my understanding of the technical and ethical implications of developing advanced analytical models, considering everything we know, and don't know, about the real, human cost of their deployment.</p>

					<p>I still have a lot to learn in that space, but I’m hoping that, through my continued part-time contribution to VITRU, we can collaborate with industries driving sustainable progress, helping to educate and support in regards to this fast-approaching tech, while trying to leverage these same innovative forces for social good. When their next client engagement starts, if I’m working elsewhere full-time, that can only be a good thing for my future employer -- I’d be deepening my knowledge of cutting edge data science methodologies under the guidance of a highly experienced researcher and professional.</p>

					<p>In her poem, <i>Autumn</i>, Nobel Laureate Louise Glück alludes to “the part of life devoted to contemplation [being] at odds with the part committed to action.” To perceive deep thought and forward momentum as diametrical is not new. Ancient <i>I Ching</i> philosophy denotes the Receptive and the Creative forces as natural complements, on account of their polarity. It is the intersection of these two forces where meaningful change is generated, and where I hope to work in the next stage of my career.</p>
