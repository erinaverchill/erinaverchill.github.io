						<p>Presently, VITRU AI is simply too early in its development as a software/consulting company to financially compensate for my contributions as a Business Development Manager full-time. The company is still in its infancy, though convincingly capable of making an impact developing custom AI software for organizations in the environmental, healthcare, and civic/governance spaces. I was somewhat of an unexpected (but welcome) addition to the team. Truthfully, artificial intelligence used to really scare me (in some cases, it still does!), but the process of slowly learning the math and code and theory behind the algorithms made them feel more digestible. I’ve reached the sobering realization that AI is already everywhere around us. That’s why, given my knowledge and professional background, I feel something of a sense of duty to educate myself on the technical and societal implications of developing advanced intelligence models with machine learning and deep learning.</p>

						<p>We were supposed to start client work in January, but I’m quickly learning that with startups, nothing ever goes as planned, and it’s been an adventure navigating how to book conversations with potential clients. Had things unfolded according to schedule, I’d currently be contracted as a Junior Data Scientist under the direction of our Founder/Chief Data Scientist.</p>
						<!-- <br> -->
						<p>I’m itching to get working on challenging technical problems in a structured environment. I miss being tasked to use math, statistics, code and nerdy software to learn something new everyday as part of my job. Thank goodness I’ve had VITRU as a sandbox for my own learning + creative development journey since the Data Analytics/Visualization course I took at UCI wrapped up in the fall. I feel so fortunate to have been reminded what empathetic, dedicated leadership looks like in just four short months, all thanks to the colleagues and mentors I’ve met working at the startup. Plus, I’ll admit I was a little rusty regarding the business norms at first. Emails. LinkedIn. GoogleDrive. My head was almost spinning. After all, my last full time role was...two years ago? Really? It’s been that long since I left Uber? How did that time go by so quickly? </p>
						<!-- <br> -->
						<p>One might wonder why I left the company when I did. Right before the IPO, after I had been there for over two years? After we had already endured the lowest points of its past regulatory and leadership blunders? I reported to a compassionate, yet appropriately challenging, Senior Manager who I deeply admired, and worked with a rock-solid team within the Internal Audit department. Our department built a reputation of being an ethical beacon when the future of the company looked grim. We built meaningful bonds with Operations, Product/Engineering, Legal, and Fintech teams across the company based on trust, respect, and committed, hard work, even when challenges felt insurmountable. Heck, we even got free meals everyday, and there was always guaranteed to be an adorable dog somewhere in the building. The fortune of my existing situation was not lost on me for a second. </p>
						<!-- <br> -->
						<p>The truth is, I learned more at Uber in my 2+ years there than I have anywhere else for that same length of time. I still miss it, but I also knew I was ready for something different. I thought I had an idea of what that was. At the time, I volunteered my free time writing content & producing events for a local nonprofit and arts/creative agency. Quite honestly, it was one of the most fulfilling and enriching times of my life, and at 24/25 years old, it felt like the right time to take a risk and pursue a creative career path. It felt like now or never. Twenty-five was also when I made the decision to quit drinking, nearly two years ago to this day. I am deeply fortunate to have had access to quality mental health care in my early twenties, for without that I may not have made that decision before it was too late. </p>
						<!-- <br> -->
						<p>I feel like I have to be candid about an experience like this because a) it’s one of the primary reasons I took such a long sabbatical from my professional career and b) it’s one of the core tenants of my personal history that drives my ambitions today. I believe everyone should have access to the mental (and overall) healthcare they need. I think of how many lives could be saved if money wasn’t an issue for the majority of folks, and I do not take for granted the support networks I had access to because of my lucrative corporate career. So it turns out I wasn’t just going to travel for a bit after I quit my job; I was getting ready to transform my life. </p>
						<!-- <br> -->
						<p>In that time, I learned a lot about myself by moving home and reconnecting with my family. I let myself feel like a kid again and indulged in a summer vacation, where I savored little things like the freedom to just sit outside and read a good book for hours on end under the sun. </p>

						<p>Some parts were bittersweet. As it turns out, it’s hard to maintain the same [social] life as before once you get sober. Some things just have to change. I wasn’t going to live events like I used to. The artist collective/record label my roommates and I had started in San Francisco felt like it was slowly drifting away with the new distance between us (obviously, this was all before COVID and Zoom’s ubiquity). Plus, it’s hardly financially sustainable to operate events -- I learned, the hard way, that even a great music lineup and sizable crowd doesn’t always typically guarantee a profit. Especially in the independent artist scene. This only deepened my respect for all of those I’ve met, who I know bust their asses to pursure their craft, doing whatever it takes to utilize that energy to foster community and uplift others throughout the process. I wasn’t cut out for it in the long haul; I just couldn’t figure out how to support myself in that field, but I’m humbled to have had the space to experiment with new ideas and concepts for connecting with people through art. </p>
